Aims
----

Aiming to make lagers and ales, so need flexible temperature control.

Tiny (4L/1 Gallon) batches :)

Would like to make the process fairly precise, starting with the fermenter.

Hardware
--------

 * 5 Litre fermenter
 * Mini-bar fridge (240VAC)
 * Raspberry Pi as controller
 * X10 gear to start/stop fridge.
 * Use a thermowell + 1-wire sensor to get temperature
 * LCD to show progress etc.

Info
----

 * Ales best at 21°C
 * Largers are good at 5-15°C (changes over time)
 * Cooler temperatures tend to create better (and clearer) beers
 * Fermentation generates heat, so in an insulated area will raise own temperature
