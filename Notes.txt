Aims
----

Fairly simple, beer brewing.

All gear low voltage (12 or less) across the board, and low amperage.

Aiming to make lagers and ales, so need flexible temperature control.

Tiny (4L/1 Gallon) batches :)

Hardware
--------

    * Airlock seal
    * Bucket design
 * Water filter for incoming water

 * Use a thermowell + 1-wire sensor to get temperature

Info
----

 * Ales (Coopers) best at 21°C
 * Largers are good at 5-15°C
 * Cooler temperatures tend to create better beers
 * Fermentation generates heat

Cool ideas
----------

 * Insulate bucket so that fermetation heat can keep it warm. Then can leave
   outside maybe, or at least not need to heat it.
 * Use as a small 12v fan (or two) to move room temp air inside if too hot.
 * Tiny 4-5L glass jug.
